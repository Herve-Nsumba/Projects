Overview
This project is a JavaScript-based calculator web app that supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division. It handles user input dynamically, performs calculations without using eval(), and adapts the display font size responsively 
to ensure readability for long inputs.
What I Mastered:
1. JavaScript Fundamentals
    i)Manipulating the DOM dynamically: creating buttons programmatically and appending them to the page.
    ii)Using event listeners (addEventListener) to handle user interaction.
    iii)Working with arrays to store button values and categorize operators and special keys.
    iv)Using control flow structures (if, else if) to implement calculator logic based on button input.
2. Calculation Logic Without eval()
   i)Implementing basic arithmetic operations manually and updating the display with the result.
3. HTML & CSS
     i) It was just another day with HTML and CSS as a chance to keep me updated and master what i know.
